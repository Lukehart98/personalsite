        <p>On 19th August 2021 I nearly died in a basejump accident, still today I am fighting with the consequenses(body-wise):<ul>
            <li>Motorical issues</li>
            <li>Mobility weaknesses</li>
            <li>Propioception difficulties</li>

                 <h3>Education</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <li>High-school diploma</li>
                    <li>some modules in business adminstration</li>
                    <li>Tunnel Instructor</li>
                 </ul>
                 <hr/>
                 <h3>Work experience</h3>
                 <p>Back in High-school programming was already super interesting for me.
                    But Sports early won the race against my informatic's side.</p>
                    <p>After I finished the High-school I went instantly to the army with 17 years.
                        I signed a contract for 13 years duty to become an airborne infantry officer. </p>
                        <p>This was one of the worst decisions in my life(besides of course going to Basejump :D)
                            After being in the troupe, I realized the army isn't the right place for me and I started my Fight to leave the army.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the army earlier than agreed is a long process and so I was still oficially a Soldier, when I had my Accident.
                        After my Accident, I was a long time in different hospitals. I was 5 weeks in an artificial koma and after waking up 
                        I did my Rehabilitation in Unfallkrankenhaus Berlin for 8 Month(Relearn to speak, walk, eat,suiting up, ...)</p>
